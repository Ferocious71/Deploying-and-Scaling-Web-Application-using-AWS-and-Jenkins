# Deploying and Scaling Web Application using- AWS,Docker,Jenkins,IaC and Kubernetes


✅✅ # Step 1: Set Up the AWS Environment

1. Set Up AWS CLI and Boto3:
   - Install AWS CLI and configure it with AWS credentials.

   - Install Boto3 for Python and configure it.

✅✅ # Step 2: Prepare the MERN Application

1. Containerize the MERN Application:

   - Ensure the MERN application is containerized using Docker. Create a Dockerfile for each component (frontend and backend).

2. Push Docker Images to Amazon ECR:

   - Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.

   - Create an Amazon ECR repository for each image.

   - Push the Docker images to their respective ECR repositories.

✅✅ # Step 3: Version Control (Git)


✅✅ # Step 4: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

1. Set Up Jenkins:

   - Install Jenkins on an EC2 instance.

   - Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins.

2. Create Jenkins Jobs:

   - Create Jenkins jobs for building and pushing Docker images to ECR.


✅✅ # Step 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Boto3

1. Define Infrastructure with Boto3 (Python Script):

   - Use Boto3 to define the infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups).

   - Define an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for the backend.
   

✅✅ # Step 6: Deploying Backend Services

1. Deploy Backend on EC2 with ASG:

   - Use Boto3 to deploy EC2 instances with the Dockerized backend application in the ASG.
   

✅✅ # Step 7: Set Up Networking

1. Create Load Balancer:

   - Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for the backend ASG.


✅✅ # Step 8: Deploying Frontend Services

1. Deploy Frontend on EC2:

   - Use Boto3 to deploy EC2 instances with the Dockerized frontend application.


✅✅ # Step 9: Kubernetes (EKS) Deployment

1. Create EKS Cluster:

   - Use eksctl or other tools to create an Amazon EKS cluster.

2. Deploy Application with Helm:

   - Use Helm to package and deploy the MERN application on EKS.
